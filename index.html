<h2>Speedrunning Wordle</h2>
	<p> Wordle is one of those games that tend to blow up out of nowhere ever year. Wordle is a game where you have to guess a different five letter word in six or less tries, daily. It garnened much attention around the beginning of 2022 most of the traction coming from Twitter and spreading thus forth. It was eventually acquired by the New York Times and now is played by <strong>300,000 people per day</strong> reaching an all time high at <strong> 2 million people per day.</strong><br>
	For this article we will be explaing tips and tricks to beat Wordle.<br>
	Now because of its popularity and constant exclamations on social media, some may think that Wordle is difficult. In fact, its pretty easy, at least for native English speakers.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>First thing to start off with is using as many <em>vowels</em> as you can.</li>
		<ul>
		<li>English only has 6 vowels,including Y, and there is a small amount of 5 letter words that only use 1 vowel.<br>
			Rather than go through random words with different vowels its better to use words like Audio or Adieu as your first choice to eliminate 4 of the 6 vowels.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Second you want to eliminate the most common constants using the vowels you either missed, got right, or a mixture of both. <em>Both</em> is preferable.
		<ul>
		<li> The letters S,T,F,R,L, and H are good combination letters that you can eliminate quite easily.</li></ul>
		</li>
	<li>Thirdly eliminate as many consants while trying to avoid using the grey ones or keeping the yellow ones in the same place.</li>
</ol>
	<p>That's basically it. Now go try it out for today's Wordle and see where it gets you. Most people finish it around the 4th and 5th try so see if you can do better.</p>
